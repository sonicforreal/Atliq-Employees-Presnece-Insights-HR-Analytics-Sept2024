Atliq Employees Presence Insights (HR Analytics) Sept2024

 
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

I began by understanding the requirements of the client and identifying areas for improvement.
 The initial step involved cleaning the data directly in Microsoft Power BI and transforming it for further exploratory analysis to provide better context. 
Most of the transformations were accomplished using DAX queries.

2. Dashboard Development

Next, I focused on creating visualizations. I added measures and simple columns to enrich the understanding of the data. 
Key functions utilized included CALCULATE, SUM, and time-based functions for days of the week and months. 
The dashboard incorporated key metrics such as Attendance %, Work from Home (WFH) %, and Sick Leave (SL) %.
To enhance usability, I included line charts that illustrate trends in employee leave patterns and relevant slicers for month selection, as well as a timeline feature to facilitate access to specific time periods.

3. Insights and Recommendations

The primary goal was to explore future requirements and understand the reasons behind employee leave, as well as to identify ways to minimize leave rates. Various factors,
 including seasonal trends and personal circumstances, may contribute to employee absences.
From the analysis of the dashboard, I observed that many employees prefer to work from home on Fridays. 
I recommend implementing a hybrid work model that allows all employees to work from home on Fridays or weekends, 
which could potentially reduce the leave rate. Alternatively, a rotating hybrid model could be introduced, where some employees work in the office while others work from home for two to three days each week, switching places regularly. 
This approach would optimize the use of company resources and could also lead to cost savings on office space.
